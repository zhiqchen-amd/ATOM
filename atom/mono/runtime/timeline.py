"""A mono kernel's per-CTA phase stamps, saved from the server (debug only).

``ATOM_MONO_TIMELINE=<prefix>``, meant for ``--enforce-eager`` (a graph replay
runs no Python, so nothing would be saved): a kernel built with its timeline
stamps writes one [CTA][point] buffer a layer, and past the warm-up steps of each
decode token count a few steps are saved as ``<prefix>_r<rank>_s<S>_<i>.pt`` --
int64 [layer][CTA][point], ``s_memrealtime`` ticks (100 MHz), a point never
reached left 0.
