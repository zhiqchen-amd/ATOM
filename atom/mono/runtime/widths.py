    ``(launcher, abi)`` pairs) compiled there without a launch: that step is a
    warmup forward before the width's graph capture, which then only records.

    Collective: every rank prepares the same width, and all agree they hold it,
    so a rank whose build failed keeps the others from launching a kernel that
    would wait on it for ever. A width refused once (a build that does not fit)
    stays refused: its steps take the original path without building again.

    A kernel with scratch refuses its width, with a warning: a persistent kernel
    needs every CTA resident at once, and one whose waves need scratch can be
    dispatched only in part (the scratch the runtime holds for the grid), its
    resident CTAs then waiting for ever on the rest."""
