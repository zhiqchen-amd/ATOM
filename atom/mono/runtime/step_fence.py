"""The step's peer fence (``DESIGN_v3`` I1): no rank pushes a step's first
pair into a peer's buffer before that peer has cleared it for the step.

A runner clears its mailboxes between steps, and a peer's push of the next
step must land after the clear. A TP collective between the two was taken for
that fence, and it is not one: aiter's custom all-reduce skips the
communication in a graph capture's warmup forward (``custom_all_reduce``
returns zeros there), and a V4.1 DSpark draft warmup of two requests found a
peer's pushes cleared by the late rank's clear. The fence is its own: after
the clear, each rank writes its step epoch into its slot at every rank's
buffer tail (never cleared, the epoch only grows) and waits until all of its
own slots reach it (``PeerBuffer.fence``).
