"""A runner's mailboxes and where a step begins with them.

A mailbox tag is a layer's, so a pair left from one step would pass for the
next step's: every buffer holding pairs is cleared before a step's first
kernel, then the peer fence (``PeerBuffer.fence``) holds every rank until all
of them cleared, so no peer's first push of the step lands on an uncleared
buffer or is wiped by a late clear. At the step's start, not its end: a step
that stopped half-way leaves nothing for the next one to trip on.
