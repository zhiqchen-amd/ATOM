"""A TP rank's share of a model's widths.

A mono kernel is built for one TP size: every per-rank width it loops over,
places tasks by or lays a region out with is a build-time constant. A model
derives all of them from ``Shard`` in one place (its ``Dims``), so a TP size
either yields every width exactly or is refused by name before anything loads.
