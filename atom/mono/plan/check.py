"""The hand-off contract of a traced kernel, checked at build time.

A mono kernel's CTAs are all co-resident and each walks the program's stages in
order, a stage's tasks spread over the grid. A poll then always makes progress if
the stage it waits on comes earlier in the program, or is its own stage and the
region an exchange (an all-reduce: a task pushes before it waits on its peers'
pushes). ``check`` holds a ``trace.Record`` to that and to the regions'
declarations: the stages that put each, the declared space (scope), and no
mailbox access on an unnamed address.
