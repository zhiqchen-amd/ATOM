"""A CTA's exact top-k for a small k, by counting: entry e of an LDS array is a
signed 64-bit sort key (a 32-bit key high, the entry's id low: key, then id,
descending), and an entry's rank is the count of entries that beat it -- no
order of arrival enters, so every CTA and rank agrees.

Counting every entry against every other is VALU-bound (one 64-bit compare an
entry pair). Past a few hundred entries, ``group_floor`` and ``compact`` first
narrow the field to the entries that can still be among the top k, and only
those are counted against each other.
