"""FP4 scoring for a DSA sparse indexer: the predicate, the ABI, the schedule.

FP4 is a change of dtype, not a second cache: `indexer_qk_rope_quant_and_cache`
writes packed E2M1 keys plus their e8m0 scales in place of the FP8 row, and
`flydsl_pa_mqa_logits_fp4[_prefill]` score them straight out of the paged cache.
Every number here is one those kernels fix, so it drifts with them.

# Persistent-grid schedule params for `pa_mqa_logits_fp4_prefill`. A metadata
# builder precomputes its cta_info with these and the scorer passes the
# matching block_k, so layout and grid agree. DeepSeek-V4 drives the same kernel
# and carries its own copy of this pair in `v4_kernels`; the two must be
# changed together until something merges them, which is not this module's to
# do. (Decode scores ragged rows through `Fp4MqaRaggedMetadata`, whose kernel
# shares its work out by length itself.)
#
# The floor is a CTA-count target, not a kernel default: the consumer takes
# `max(floor, rows)`, so it only adds split-K to grids too small to fill the
# GPU and is an identity for the wide ones. Splits are numerically inert --
# each CTA gets a disjoint KV-column range, no cross-CTA partial sums.
#
# It cannot be fitted to the work. A CUDAGraph bakes the grid at capture,
# while the work is `rows * ceil(ctx / block_k)` and the context term is only
# known per replay; of what capture does know, the batch size measures flat, so
# there is nothing to derive one from. It is therefore the smallest
# worst-case regret over the served context range rather than any shape's
# optimum -- re-tune against a real workload mix. At prefill rows=1024 and
