    (gating, histogram, scatter) because the EP path cannot use ``routing()``:
    that starts from router logits, but after the all-to-all the top-k choice is
    already made and the rows have been permuted across ranks. What stays here is
    the tile geometry, the ExptData allocation and the packaging -- shaped by
    three facts about the post-dispatch buffer:
    1. Rows are per-token: mori sends one copy per (token, destination rank), so
       a row carries the full top-k tuple with only *some* entries owned here.
       Non-local entries go to a sentinel bin that is sliced off the histogram,
       so the matmul schedules no block for them.
    2. The flat gate index must stay ``row * topk + slot``, because the matmul
       recovers the activation row as ``gather_idx // N_EXPTS_ACT``. Non-local
       entries are therefore **masked, never compacted** -- compacting would
       break that arithmetic and silently read the wrong rows.
    3. ``num_local_tokens`` is a device tensor and rows past it hold garbage from
       the over-allocated receive buffer. Masking them the same way keeps this
       function sync-free and its shapes static (so it stays cudagraph-safe).
       It is REQUIRED, not optional: the mori buffer always has M > R, so
       skipping the row mask would fold garbage rows into the histogram as live
       gates -- silently wrong rather than an error.
    Returns ``(routing_data, gather_indx, scatter_indx, gate_valid, dst_row)`` --
    the first three match ``routing()``; ``gate_valid`` is the extra piece EP
    needs, since ``routing()`` never produces dead gates. ``dst_row`` is None

    Interleaved is the w4 kernels' native layout: ``_swiglu`` splits
    ``reshape(M, N // 2, 2)`` on the trailing axis, i.e. adjacent gate/up pairs,
    so a BLOCK_N tile carries both halves and the activation fuses into GEMM1's
    write-back. On a8w4 ``out_mx_quant=True`` folds the MXFP8 requant in with it,
    so the whole layer is two launches:

        MXFP8 quant -> GEMM1(a8w4, fused SiLU + MX requant) -> GEMM2(a8w4)

    against four on the GGUU path (GEMM1 -> fused_clamp_act_mul ->
    downcast_to_mxfp -> GEMM2), which needs the separate steps precisely because
    a tile there spans only gate *or* only up.

    ``alpha=1.0`` with ``swiglu_add_residual=False`` is plain SiLU
    (``s * linear``); GPT-OSS's ``s * (linear + 1)`` variant is NOT served here.

    a8w4 is the default. a4w4 -- selected by ``ATOM_USE_TRITON_MOE_A4W4`` or an
    MXFP4-activation checkpoint -- takes the SAME weights (both are w4), so it
    needs no extra weight prep or memory; it just costs one launch more, since
    ``moe_gemm_a4w4`` has no ``out_mx_quant`` and must re-quantise the
    intermediate separately. Measured on gfx950 that was 1.22-1.28x overall (see
    _test/ep_moe_bench_report.md): the a4w4 GEMMs are genuinely faster (halved
    weight traffic) but the doubled quant costs more than the GEMM saving.

    ``y_out``, when given, is where GEMM2's grouped reduction writes -- typically
    the leading rows of a taller caller-owned buffer, so the EP path can hand
    mori's combine a full-M tensor without copying this result into it. It is
    GEMM2's output only; GEMM1's intermediate is always kernel-allocated.

    ``ep_scatter`` replaces that reduction entirely: GEMM2 delivers its un-reduced
    rows into a peer combine-staging window and the sum happens in the EP combine,
    once every rank has delivered. Mutually exclusive with ``y_out`` -- one names a
    reduced output, the other says there is no local reduction to produce one.

    Functionally ``MegaMoEGfx1250.forward`` with its own grouped flydsl GEMM
    swapped for ours: dispatch, experts, fused combine. The transport half is
    MegaMoE's -- the same ``_dispatch`` and ``_combine``, so the same mori
    all-to-all and the same barrier-free reduce -- and only the expert GEMM in
    the middle differs.

    Written against MegaMoE's INTERNALS on purpose. The alternative is a public
    transport-only API on MegaMoE (dispatch / combine_scatter_target / combine),
    which is a change to aiter for ATOM's benefit; keeping the orchestration here
    means aiter stays untouched and this file owns the whole triton path, so the
    dispatch and combine underneath can later be replaced with our own without
    moving anything else. The cost is a binding to four private names --
    ``_dispatch``, ``_combine``, ``_arena``, ``_config`` -- checked below so an
    aiter refactor fails loudly here rather than silently misbehaving.

    ``recv_token_bound`` caps how many recv slots the experts are shown (the
    dispatch always fills a world*max_tokens_per_rank arena); ``m_eff`` narrows
    it further, and is the Triton-only second stage -- see MoriV2ModularKernel.

    GEMM2 delivers its un-reduced rows straight into the combine staging window,
    so there is no local reduction and no ``y_out``: the summing happens inside
    the combine once every rank has delivered.
