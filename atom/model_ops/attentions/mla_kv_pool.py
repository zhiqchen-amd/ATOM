"""The paged KV of a set of MLA layers: what a block costs, and where it lives.

The MHA pool's sibling, and separate from the attention backend for the same
reason (`mha_kv_pool`): a backend also owns per-step metadata, and that half is
per-runner.

MLA packs k_c and k_pe into one row and absorbs V into the latent, so a block
is one tensor rather than four -- no split K/V, no dequantization scales. The
sparse variants add a second: an indexer key cache owned by only some layers,
holding one row per token or, where the indexer pools, fewer. Both are fields;
their differing layer counts and row counts are what `EntryField` already says.

An entry here is a *scheduler* block, which is the index space `page_pool`
charges. That is not always the backend's own page: MLA usually pages at size 1
(`ATOM_MLA_PAGE_SIZE`), so `block_ratio` rows of the allocation make up one
entry. Keeping the entry at the scheduler block is what lets a row of
`region_tensors` be the unit a transfer registers, with no `block_ratio` factor
applied after the fact.
