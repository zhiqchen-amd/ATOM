"""The paged KV of a set of MHA layers: what an entry costs, and where it lives.

Separate from the attention backend because a backend also owns per-step
metadata, and that half is per-runner: asking for a second pool by building a
second builder would overwrite the first's `forward_vars`. So anything wanting
a pool of MHA layers can have one -- the model's own, and a draft's.

Two units, and the pool shapes by exactly one. `block_size` is the caller's
block, the unit every view is taken at; an entry is `blocks_per_entry` of them
laid end to end, and exists only because that is what `page_pool` charges per.
Nothing reads at an entry.

A field says what an entry costs; `kv_views` says how those bytes read, and is
the only place the element order may be written -- a second copy of it agrees
on every byte while disagreeing on a shape, which no size check can see.
