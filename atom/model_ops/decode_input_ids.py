"""Fill a decode step's `input_ids` for the sequences carried over on GPU.

A decode step feeds each request `[anchor, draft_0 .. draft_{n-1}]`, where the
anchor is the id that request sampled last step. That id lives in one of two
places:

* a request the previous forward also held ("deferred") sampled it on the GPU
  and it was never copied to the host -- that is the whole point of deferred
  output, which trades a D2H sync for reading `prev_token_ids` in place;
* a request the scheduler admitted since then has its id on the host, already
  written into `batch.scheduled_tokens` at that request's own token offset.

The caller stages `scheduled_tokens` over the whole decode region first, which
is correct by construction for the second kind, then calls this to overwrite
the spans belonging to the first.

Addressing: one program per request, writing `[cu[i], cu[i+1])`. The span comes
from the same `cu` the rest of the step uses, so per-request length is whatever
that says -- uniform `q` for a rectangular MTP step, per-request lengths under
DSpark's ragged buckets, no separate copy of "how long is each one" to drift.

Past `cu[bs]` come the graph's padded rows, zeroed by programs of the same
launch. Nobody else writes them and the MoE path does consume them, so they
would otherwise carry the previous forward's ids; zero is a legal vocab id. One
launch and not two, because the two regions are disjoint by construction.

The predecessor of this kernel placed the two kinds as two contiguous BLOCKS
(`[deferred | new]`, or `[new | deferred]` when the previous forward was a
prefill). The scheduler does not order the batch that way -- the two interleave
-- so every request could receive a neighbour's anchor. It went unseen because
the block layout only comes up when a forward lands between two decode steps
and displaces the previous batch, which is what a chunked prefill does. Writing
each request's own span keeps that unexpressible.
