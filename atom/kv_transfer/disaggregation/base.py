"""
Abstract base classes for KV cache connectors.

These interfaces decouple the engine from any specific transfer backend
(e.g. MoRIIO/RDMA, NCCL P2P).  Concrete implementations live in
separate modules and are registered via :class:`KVConnectorFactory`.

Two roles are defined:

- **Worker-side** (:class:`KVConnectorBase`): runs inside each TP rank,
  handles RDMA / network I/O, and reports transfer completion.
- **Scheduler-side** (:class:`KVConnectorSchedulerBase`): runs in the
  scheduler process, manages transfer lifecycle and metadata.
