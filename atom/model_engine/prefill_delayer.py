"""
PrefillDelayer — a cross-DP-rank prefill *coalescer* for ATOM.

Purpose
-------
Under DP-attention each rank schedules independently. Left alone, ranks fire
many prefill forwards that each carry only a handful of tokens (a short fresh
prompt, or the small tail chunk of a chunked prefill). Every prefill forward
has ~fixed cost (kernel launch, pad-to-shape, the lockstep MoE all-to-all), so a
forward carrying 500 of a 16384-token budget wastes ~97% of that forward.

The delayer has two related jobs: **hold back prefill admission until the
accumulated prefill is worth a forward, then release** — Nagle's algorithm for
prefill — and optionally protect a fixed number of decode passes after every
prefill. While it holds, decode keeps running; TTFT is bounded so a held request
never starves.

Single-rank / TP-only mode
--------------------------
With ``cpu_group=None`` (``dp_size=1``) the delayer runs the same coalescer
locally and skips the cross-rank ``all_reduce`` — a single scheduler drives all
TP workers, so there is no cross-rank phase to align. Only the batching value
remains (fill / stall / ttft / kv bounds decide FIRE/HOLD from this rank's own
counts); the ``n_prefillable < dp_size`` alignment gate is vacuous.

It is NOT about mixing prefill+decode in one forward. It DOES preserve cross-DP
phase alignment: it only releases when every rank is prefill-ready (so all ranks
enter prefill together and the MoE collective stays aligned), except when a
must-fire bound forces release regardless.

Decision (evaluated every tick, on every rank, in lockstep)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Each rank reports local state; a single cpu ``all_reduce(SUM)`` reduces it; then
every rank computes the SAME FIRE/HOLD from the reduced values:

  n_prefillable   = #ranks with admittable prefill (SUM of a 0/1 flag)
  G_pending       = total pending prefill tokens across ranks (fresh + partial
                    remaining, each rank capped at the token budget)
  G_running_dec   = total decode seqs across ranks
  any_kv_high/low = any prefillable rank at/above / below a KV watermark
  any_partial     = any rank mid-chunked-prefill
  any_prefill_ran = any rank completed a prefill forward on the previous tick

  if any_prefill_ran:                              arm decode interval
  if post-prefill decode interval is active and decode exists: HOLD
  if n_prefillable == 0:                          FIRE   # nothing to do (vacuous)
  # -- must-fire bounds (release even if unaligned / underfilled) --
  if G_running_dec == 0:                          FIRE   # no decode to hide the wait behind
  if any_kv_high or any_kv_low:                   FIRE   # KV pressure / starvation
  if hold_ticks >= ttft_max_ticks:                FIRE   # TTFT bound
  if any_partial and hold_ticks >= partial_max_ticks: FIRE  # partial holds KV — tight bound
  # -- alignment gate: never fire while some rank lacks prefill (anti-skew) --
  if n_prefillable < dp_size:                     HOLD
  # -- goal: fire once the aggregate fills a worthwhile forward --
  fill = G_pending / (n_prefillable * budget)
  if fill >= target_fill:                         FIRE
  # -- adaptive give-up: queue stopped growing, waiting longer is futile --
  if G_pending <= prev_G_pending:  stall += 1  else  stall = 0
  if stall >= stall_ticks:                        FIRE
  HOLD

Why SUM (not MAX)
-----------------
A MAX ("fire as soon as the busiest rank is ready") drags quiet ranks into
firing tiny prefills. A SUM/aggregate-fill target holds until the forward is
collectively worthwhile, so quiet ranks keep accumulating during the hold and
fire larger when release finally happens. Under-balanced load a quiet rank still
fires smaller — that is a request-routing problem, out of scope here.

Cross-DP comms
--------------
Single ``all_reduce(SUM)`` over an 8-int64 cpu buffer (gloo-safe). Booleans are
encoded as 0/1 and read back as ``sum > 0`` (logical OR). All timing is
tick-based (``hold_ticks``), which is deterministic across ranks — no per-rank
wall-clock, so ranks never diverge on a timeout boundary. Fail-open on a
collective error (a peer dying should not crash schedule()); the guarded
DP-state barrier drives shutdown.

                release once held for partial_max_ticks (it holds KV).
