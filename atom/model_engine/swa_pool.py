class SlidingWindowPool:
    """Content-addressed sliding-window KV block pool (DeepSeek-V4 SWA).

    Owns an independent free-list + content-hash map so out-of-window SWA blocks
    can be freed while the compressed blocks persist. Mirrors vLLM's
    `SlidingWindowManager`; `BlockManager` holds one instance (`self.swa`) and
    delegates all SWA lifecycle here, driving it in lockstep with the compressed
    pool. `seq.swa_block_table` lives on `Sequence` (shared with attention / PD);
    this pool only reads/writes it.

    Self-guarding: when `num_blocks == 0` (non-V4 models) the pool is DISABLED —
    every method is an identity/no-op, so `BlockManager` can call it
    unconditionally (no `if swa_enabled` scattered at the call sites). `has_free`
    returns True and `bounded_hit` returns the input length, so admission and
    hit-length are byte-identical to a no-SWA build.

    Hashing note: the chained content hash is computed by BlockManager (shared by
    the compressed and SWA pools). `bounded_hit` / `claim_cached` / `publish_hash`
    receive `h`/`block_hashes` as inputs — this pool never recomputes them, so it
    stays aligned with the compressed prefix.
