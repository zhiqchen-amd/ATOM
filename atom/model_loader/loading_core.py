"""Checkpoint -> parameter loading, with no GPU or AITER dependency.

`load_model` in `loader.py` is a thin wrapper that binds the host-specific
callables below and then runs post-processing; everything that decides *which*
checkpoint tensor lands in *which* parameter lives here.  The split exists so
this logic is unit-testable on a plain CPU runner — the unit-test gate has no
AITER build, and `loader.py` imports AITER at module level.
