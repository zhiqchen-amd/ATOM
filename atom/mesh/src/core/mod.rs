//! Core abstractions for Atomesh
//!
//! This module contains the fundamental types and traits used throughout the router:
//! - Worker trait and implementations
//! - Error types
//! - Circuit breaker for reliability
//! - Token buckets for rate limiting
//! - Workflow steps for multi-step operations
//! - Common utilities
