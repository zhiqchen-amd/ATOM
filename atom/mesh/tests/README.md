# Mesh Integration Tests

This directory contains the integration test suite for **atom/mesh**, organized by functional area. All tests run with `cargo test` and do not require a GPU or real inference backend — they use mock workers and in-memory routers.

## Directory Structure

```

## Test Infrastructure

The `common/` directory provides shared test utilities used across all test modules:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mock_worker.rs` | Mock HTTP server simulating an inference worker (configurable health, delays, failure rates) |
| `mock_openai_server.rs` | Mock OpenAI-compatible server for end-to-end testing |
| `test_app.rs` | `AppTestContext` — builds a full router app stack for integration testing |
| `test_config.rs` | `TestRouterConfig` / `TestWorkerConfig` — helpers for constructing test configurations |
| `streaming_helpers.rs` | Utilities for testing SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming responses |

## API Tests (`api/`)

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `api_endpoints_test.rs` | 35 | Core HTTP endpoint coverage: `/liveness`, `/readiness`, `/health`, `/health_generate`, `/generate`, `/v1/chat/completions`. Tests status codes, response formats, error handling, concurrent requests, and health check behavior with healthy/unhealthy workers. |
| `parser_endpoints_test.rs` | 12 | Tests for `/parse/function_call` and `/parse/reasoning` endpoints. Verifies function call extraction from model output and reasoning/thinking block parsing. |
| `request_formats_test.rs` | 6 | Request format validation for `/generate`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `/v1/completions`. Tests various payload shapes: text, input_ids, batch requests, sampling params, and special parameters (logprobs, json_schema, ignore_eos). |
| `responses_api_test.rs` | 11 | Responses API (conversations) CRUD operations. Tests creating, listing, retrieving, and deleting conversation sessions via the conversation handlers. |
| `streaming_tests.rs` | 7 | SSE streaming response tests. Verifies streaming output for `/generate` and `/v1/chat/completions`, including chunked transfer and stream termination. |

## Routing Tests (`routing/`)

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `load_balancing_test.rs` | 8 | Load balancing policy tests: round_robin, random, cache_aware, and other policies. Verifies request distribution across workers. |
| `power_of_two_test.rs` | 3 | Power of Two Choices algorithm tests. Selects the less loaded worker from two random candidates. |
| `cache_aware_backward_compat_test.rs` | 3 | Backward compatibility tests for CacheAwarePolicy with empty model IDs and legacy configurations. |
| `header_forwarding_test.rs` | 6 | Header propagation tests. Verifies that custom headers are correctly forwarded from client through the router to backend workers. |
| `payload_size_test.rs` | 5 | Request payload size limit tests. Verifies behavior with oversized payloads and boundary conditions. |
| `pd_routing_test.rs` | 3 | Prefill/Decode disaggregation routing. Tests routing decisions that split prefill and decode phases to different workers. |
| `pd_topology_test.rs` | 18 | PD topology end-to-end tests: 1P1D, 2P2D, and Regular mode. Verifies complete request flows through the router with mock worker backends. |
| `test_pd_routing.rs` | 23 | PD routing unit-level tests. Covers PD selection policies, worker assignment, context construction, and routing decisions with various topology configurations. |
| `policy_registry_integration.rs` | 3 | PolicyRegistry integration with RouterManager. Tests policy registration, lookup, and lifecycle management. |
| `worker_management_test.rs` | 3 | Dynamic worker management API: listing workers via `GET /workers`, routing with multiple workers, and request handling during worker changes. |

## Reliability Tests (`reliability/`)

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `circuit_breaker_test.rs` | 4 | Circuit breaker state machine: closed → open → half-open → recovery. Tests failure threshold detection and automatic recovery. |
| `fault_tolerance_test.rs` | 5 | System resilience under worker failures, network issues, and recovery scenarios. Verifies graceful degradation when backends become unavailable. |
| `rate_limiting_test.rs` | 4 | Rate limiting and concurrency control. Tests request throttling, burst handling, and concurrent request limits. |
| `retries_test.rs` | 4 | Retry mechanism: exponential backoff, max retry limits, and retry-on-failure behavior for transient errors. |

## Security Tests (`security/`)

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `auth_test.rs` | 2 | Inference and health endpoint access when authentication is not configured. |

## Protocol Spec Tests (`spec/`)

Contract tests that verify serialization/deserialization behavior of protocol types used by mesh. These ensure the external `openai-protocol` crate's types behave as mesh expects.

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `chat_completion.rs` | 16 | `ChatCompletionRequest` normalization via the `Normalizable` trait. Tests deprecated field conversion: `max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens`, `functions` → `tools`, `function_call` → `tool_choice`. Also covers `stream_options` validation and tool_choice cross-referencing. |
| `chat_message.rs` | 5 | `ChatMessage` tagged enum deserialization. Verifies that the `role` field correctly tags messages into System, User, Assistant, and Tool variants, and that invalid roles are rejected. |
| `responses.rs` | 36 | `ResponsesRequest` validation and construction. Tests field defaults, parameter validation, tool configuration, reasoning settings, and edge cases for the Responses API request type. |

## Standalone Tests (root level)

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `inflight_tracker_test.rs` | 3 | Inflight request tracker for observability. Tests increment/decrement of active request counts and concurrent tracking accuracy. |
| `load_guard_raii_test.rs` | 6 | `WorkerLoadGuard` RAII pattern with response body attachment. Verifies that load counters properly decrement when response bodies are consumed or dropped (client disconnect simulation), including dual prefill/decode guard scenarios. |
| `metrics_aggregator_test.rs` | 5 | Prometheus metrics aggregation from multiple workers. Tests merging of counter, gauge, and histogram metrics with label injection and deduplication. |
