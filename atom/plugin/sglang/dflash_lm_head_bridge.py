"""Route DFLASH draft greedy sampling through ATOM's TP-sharded lm_head.

SGLang's ``DFlashWorkerV2._greedy_sample_from_vocab_parallel_head`` decides how
to reduce the target lm_head to one token id per draft position:

    if not hasattr(lm_head, "shard_indices"):
        logits = torch.matmul(hs, weight.T)
        out = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)      # local index used as a token id
        return out
    ...                                          # SGLang's own TP reduction

The implicit assumption is "no ``shard_indices`` means the head is not
vocab-parallel". ATOM's ``ParallelLMHead`` breaks it: the head *is* sharded
(``vocab_start_idx = num_embeddings // tp_size * tp_rank``) but carries ATOM's
own sharding ABI rather than SGLang's ``VocabParallelEmbeddingShardIndices``.
At TP8 the stock path therefore turns a per-rank local vocab index into a
global token id, and DFLASH drafts garbage.

ATOM's head already exposes exactly the reduction DFLASH needs:
``compute_argmax_token()`` takes the per-rank argmax and all-gathers only the
``[N, 2]`` (value, global-id) pairs instead of the ``[N, vocab]`` logits.
This patch makes the worker prefer it when present.

Why a monkey patch rather than teaching ATOM to publish ``shard_indices``:
publishing it would silently reroute *every* ATOM model's DFLASH sampling
through SGLang's implementation (``torch.matmul`` instead of ATOM's tuned GEMM,
and SGLang's path ignores ``lm_head.bias``). Patching one method keeps the
blast radius at the single model family that opts in, which matches how the
plugin already handles SGLang divergences -- see
``deepseek_v4_bridge.install_deepseek_v4_proxy_pool_patch`` and
``runtime/load_config_patch.apply_load_config_patch``.

The patched method is byte-identical between the pinned SGLang branch and
official ``v0.5.15.post1``, so the patch is not tied to the experimental
branch. It degrades to the stock implementation whenever the head does not
provide ``compute_argmax_token``.
