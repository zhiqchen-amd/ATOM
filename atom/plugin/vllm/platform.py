    1. Enable prefix caching via SWA recompute: V4's per-request SWA
       sliding-window ring is not carried by vLLM's block-level prefix cache
       (only the CSA/HCA compressed pages are). Rather than disable caching, we
       install a KVCacheManager patch that, on a prefix hit, drops the last
       ``ceil(win_with_spec / block_size)`` cached blocks so the SWA tail is
       re-forwarded and the ring is repopulated (mirrors native ATOM "fix B'").
       See ``deepseek_v4_prefix_patch``.

    2. Guard the non-chunked oversized forward: with chunked prefill off, vLLM
       couples max_num_batched_tokens to max_model_len, so a native max_model_len
       forces a single ~max_model_len-token forward that overflows int32 element
       offsets in per-token kernels. Fail fast with an actionable error instead
       of crashing with "illegal memory access". Enable chunked prefill for long
       context.
