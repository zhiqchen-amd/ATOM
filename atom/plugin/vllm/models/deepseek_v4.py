"""vLLM-specific DeepSeek-V4 model.

This module reuses the native ATOM DeepSeek-V4 implementation
(:mod:`atom.models.deepseek_v4`) unchanged and only layers on the behaviour
that vLLM's graph-mode execution requires. The single vLLM-specific concern is
reconciling the padded CUDA-graph bucket width against the sparse-attention
metadata in the graph-break attention op (see ``DeepseekV4AttentionVllm``).

It follows the same construction-swap pattern as ``qwen3_next``: the
``DeepseekV4ForCausalLM`` subclass temporarily rebinds the module-global
``DeepseekV4Attention`` so the whole model tree is built with the vLLM attention
variant, then restores it.

    """DeepSeek-V4 sparse indexer with vLLM mixed-batch decode/prefill split.

    Native ATOM serves decode and prefill in *separate* forward passes, so its
    ``indexer_score_topk`` can route the whole batch by ``is_prefill``: pure
    decode -> fixed-shape paged ``_score_topk_decode``; pure prefill -> dense
    ``_score_topk_prefill``.

    vLLM continuous batching instead produces MIXED batches (chunked-prefill
    rows + running decode rows) that ATOM classifies as PREFILL (batch
    ``max_query_len`` > 1). Routing the decode rows through the dense
    ``fp8_mqa_logits`` prefill path makes its ``[total_tokens, total_committed]``
    logits sum EVERY running seq's committed K into ``total_committed`` —
    quadratic in batch size, which OOMs the GPU at high concurrency.

    Mirror native ATOM by splitting the mixed batch here: vLLM reorders decode
    rows (query_len <= 1[+num_spec]) to the FRONT (``reorder_batch_threshold``),
    so the split is a contiguous prefix. Decode rows take the fixed-shape paged
    path (bounded per-seq, no batch-sum); prefill rows take the dense path whose
    ``total_committed`` the bridge (``_populate_indexer``) now builds over the
    PREFILL sub-batch only. This override lives in the vLLM plugin so native
    ATOM behaviour is untouched.

    Only the PREFILL-classified branch changes. The pure-decode branch is
    byte-for-byte the native call, so the FULL-CUDAGraph-captured decode replay
    path is unaffected; the split runs eager (mixed batches are always
    PIECEWISE, never FULL-captured), introducing no new captured shapes or
    Python branches into any graph.

    """DeepSeek-V4 attention with vLLM piecewise-CUDA-graph reconciliation.

    Under ``cudagraph_mode=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`` vLLM captures/replays the dense
    regions of ATOM's torch.compiled graph at the padded bucket width, while the
    eager attention split op (a graph break) runs at that same padded width. So
    for a prefill/mixed batch whose bucket was captured, ``x`` / ``positions``
    (and every downstream per-token projection) arrive padded to ``T_pad``, but
    the sparse-attention metadata is built for the *real* token count (the
    bridge's prefill path sets ``batch_id_per_token`` to length == real tokens).

    There are two eager entry points, and ``DeepseekV4Attention.forward`` picks
    between them by cudagraph mode, so BOTH must reconcile the padding:

    * WIDE split (FULL / NONE): the whole attention is one eager op
      (``v4_attention_with_output``) that calls ``forward_impl`` — reconciled in
      the ``forward_impl`` override below.
    * NARROW split (PIECEWISE — the FULL_AND_PIECEWISE prefill/mixed path): the
      Q/KV/indexer projections run as a *captured* dense piece (``_attn_pre``)
      at the padded width and the attention runs as three ops, never through
      ``forward_impl`` — reconciled in the ``_sparse_attention`` override below,
      which is the one of the three that reads the real-sized metadata. (This is
      the path exercised by the launch config; without that clip the padded
      ``q`` reaches ``sparse_attn_v4_paged_prefill`` while ``kv_indptr_prefix``
      is real-sized.)

    In both, slice every per-token input down to the real token count before the
    (unchanged) native attention so per-token Q rows match the ``kv_indptr``
    arrays — otherwise the paged-prefill kernel aborts with ``kv_indptr_prefix
    length must be N+1`` — then pad the output back to ``T_pad`` so the next
    captured dense region (and the op's ``empty_like`` fake-meta / piecewise
    output buffer, both keyed by the padded row count) see the full bucket width.

    Decode is fully captured (incl. these ops) with metadata already padded to
    the bucket, so it runs at the padded width and must NOT be sliced. The padded
    rows are never sampled (``logits_indices`` reference real positions only).
