"""Map vLLM's flat KV-cache registration onto ATOM's ``KVCacheTensor`` list.

vLLM hands a connector ``{layer_name: tensor}`` and says nothing about what is
inside each tensor. ATOM's offload codec instead wants, per layer, the movable
tensors named apart (``k_cache`` / ``v_cache`` / scales / ``index_cache``),
because it moves each one as its own contiguous byte segment. This module is
that translation, and nothing else -- no transfer policy, no LMCache.

Why the split matters (MiniMax-M3, the model that forced this):

    dense layers  (nb, 1, bs, 2*hd)       K and V interleaved per token
    sparse layers (nb, 2, bs, nh, hd)     K and V in two SEPARATE regions
    index caches  (nb, bs, hd)            DSA indexer keys, one per sparse layer

A sparse layer's tensor is NOT contiguous as a whole: its ``stride(1)`` jumps
across the entire K region (measured on M3-MXFP4: shape ``(59454, 2, 128, 1,
128)``, stride ``(16384, 974094336, 128, 128, 1)``). ``DenseKVByteCodec``
rejects non-contiguous segments, so the whole tensor cannot be one segment --
but ``t[:, 0]`` and ``t[:, 1]`` each ARE contiguous, and that is exactly the
``k_cache`` / ``v_cache`` pair the codec already expects. Dense layers stay
whole: their K and V interleave inside a block, so the block's bytes are one
opaque run and splitting them would be meaningless.

The codec never interprets these bytes, so "which tensor is K" only has to be
consistent between save and restore -- not semantically right.

What vLLM does NOT hand over is quantisation state. M3's sparse layers keep an
fp32 scale per token per head next to the fp8 cache, on the layer object; the
registration dict has only the caches. Restoring mantissas against the previous
occupant's scales is silent corruption, so the layers are asked for their scales
here and a layer that clearly owns per-block scales without a way to report them
is a hard error rather than a quiet omission.
