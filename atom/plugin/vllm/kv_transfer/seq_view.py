"""Present a vLLM ``Request`` as the ``seq`` ATOM's offload scheduler expects.

ATOM's offload scheduler was written against ``atom.model_engine.sequence.
Sequence``. It reads nine attributes off it, four of which are offload's own
mutable bookkeeping, and -- importantly -- it *stores the object* and later
compares identity (``previous is not seq``, ``entry[0] is not seq``) to detect
that a request id was reused by a new request. So a view must be created ONCE
per request and reused; handing out a fresh wrapper per call would look like a
new request every step and keep resetting the load lifecycle.

The read-only half is projected from the vLLM Request; the mutable half lives
here, exactly as it lives on ATOM's Sequence.
