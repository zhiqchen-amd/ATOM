"""A CTA's exact top-k of up to ``LDS_KEYS`` fp32 values, the answer of aiter's
``top_k_per_row_decode(stable=True)``: ranked by the fp32 bits' u32 order key
(-0 below +0, NaN above +inf), ties to the lowest index, emitted ascending by
index, -1 padded. P0.7 pinned the key and the tie rule against aiter;
``lds_topk_timing.py CHECK=1`` (skill mono-indexer) pins this routine against
that rule on ties, +-0, NaN and +-inf at every edge n.

Thread i holds ``per_thread`` consecutive indices from i x per_thread, as
keys in LDS, so thread order is index order and one block scan places the
winners. Four 8-bit radix passes find the k-th key; integer counts, so the
answer does not depend on arrival order.
