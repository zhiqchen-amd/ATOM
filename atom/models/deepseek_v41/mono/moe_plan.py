"""Every per-step decision of which K2b ug flags (UGF) and intermediate rows
(MID) the ug stage writes and the down stage reads, defined once (DESIGN_v3
4.9, I3), the way ``index_plan`` does the indexer's.

The route table (``stage_route``) gives each expert with picks a slot of U, its
picks a run from ``slot_first``, and, past one token tile, its picks tiles of
``TILE`` from ``tile_first`` (each tile's slot ``tile_slot``). An ug task covers
a unit -- a slot, or past one token tile a pick tile -- and one of ``ug_parts`` parts
of the intermediate; its flag is ``ug_flag``. A down round polls each of its
slots' flags (``polled_tile`` its tiles) before it reads their MID rows. Called
by the kernel on traced Int32 and by the CPU property test on Python ints.
