"""Every per-step decision of which mailbox cells the indexer writes and reads,
defined once (DESIGN_v3 4.9, I3).

Each function takes a token's ``bound`` -- how many columns its scorer may read:
``step.visible[ratio]``, or the candidate table's context on a REINDEX layer --
and is called both by the kernel (on traced Int32) and by the CPU property test
(on Python ints), so the test checks what the kernel runs. Only non-negative
operands reach ``//`` and ``%``, where Python's floor and the device's
truncation agree; ``i32`` asserts the device's range on the CPU side.
