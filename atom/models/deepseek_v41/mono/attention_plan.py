"""Every per-step decision of which attention mailbox cells the score stage
writes and the PV stage polls (AM / AL / AP, a split each), defined once
(DESIGN_v3 4.9, I3), the way ``index_plan`` does the indexer's.

A token's keys are its selection's valid ids then its window rows: ``kv_len``.
The score stage's tasks cover every split of a (token, head tile) and write the
ones ``written_splits`` counts; the PV stage polls ``polled_split`` of each of
its splits. Called by the kernel on traced Int32 and by the CPU property test on
Python ints (``index_plan``'s rules: non-negative ``//`` operands only).
