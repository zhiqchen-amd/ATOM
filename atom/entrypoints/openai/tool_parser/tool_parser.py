"""One reading of a model's tool-call syntax, driven by one engine.

A format used to be read twice: ``parse`` took a complete output and the
``process``/``flush`` state machine took it a chunk at a time. Both had to
decide where content ends, whether an unclosed tag is a call or a quotation,
what to do with a region that parses to nothing, and which bytes are framing --
so every one of those rules existed six times over, once per format, in two
copies. Three rounds of review found the copies disagreeing about all four,
and every disagreement is a response a client gets one way with
``stream=false`` and another with ``stream=true``.

So a format now declares only what is particular to it:

``START_MARKERS``     literals that must not be split across a chunk boundary
``opens_region``      which of those hand the stream over (the rest are framing)
``parse_region``      what one region's bytes mean -- the calls, and the two
                      offsets that bracket the format's own markup

and :class:`ToolCallStreamParser` -- the engine -- owns everything else:
reading ahead of the region, releasing content, dropping framing, the rule
that a start marker is not a promise, stamping call indices, and handing back
whatever followed the markup. ``stream=false`` is the engine run over a single
chunk, so the two modes cannot disagree: there is nothing left for them to
disagree with.

        Where a call's own pattern *ends* is part of that meaning, and it has
        five terminators, not four: its closing tag, the next parameter, the
        end of the call, end of input, and **the next call's opener**. Four of

        data -- ``city="Par<tool_call>"``. The call count stayed right either
        way, which is what hid it.

        ``at_end`` is whether more bytes can still arrive for this region, and
        it is the *only* difference between the two questions this used to be

        yet", and accepting one let a chunk boundary landing one character
        into ``<br>`` name a tool for prose.

        The engine calls this with ``at_end=False`` to find the name to
        announce early. That is what makes the early name and the parsed call
        agree by construction: they are the same enumeration of the same
        function over a prefix and then the whole. There used to be a separate
        ``peek_name`` per format, and its disagreements with this were
        the single most repeated defect in this module -- most recently a
        DeepSeek-V4 response whose peek skipped a self-closing
        ``<invoke name="x"/>`` that the parse returned first, putting three
        tool calls on the wire where the model had written two.
