"""DeepSeek-V4 DSML tool-call format::

    <｜DSML｜invoke name="NAME">

``string="true"`` -> value is a raw string; ``string="false"`` -> value is JSON.
DeepSeek-V4-Flash occasionally malforms this (singular ``tool_call``, a missing
``invoke`` wrapper, or params without ``string=``); the parser recovers those
best-effort: it infers a dropped tool name from the parameter signature vs the
request's ``tools`` and infers a missing value type from the schema / JSON.

Inferring a name has two conditions, both load-bearing: only at end of region,
since an ``<invoke>`` still arriving names the tool outright, and only when
some declared tool shares a parameter.
