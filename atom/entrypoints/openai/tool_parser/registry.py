"""Format detection.

Several formats share tags and are only told apart by a discriminator that a
later entry would also match, so detection order is load-bearing. `_DETECT_ORDER`
is the single place that ordering is expressed — do not reorder without
re-reading the notes on each entry.

It is consulted on a *rendered chat template*, at startup, and nowhere else.
Running it on a model's output as well was the same question asked of worse
evidence: a template states the format it taught the model, while an output
only exhibits whatever it happens to contain, so an ordinary answer quoting
`<|tool_calls_section_begin|>` was read as a Kimi section and everything after
it deleted — on the non-streaming path only, because streaming had already
been given the startup answer. One question, one place to ask it.

"""Why ``tool_choice: "none"`` is a flag and not "use no parser".

`tool_choice: "none"` used to be enforced where the events were *sent*, twelve
places across two endpoints, while the parser went on consuming the region. So
the model's own words were deleted rather than its call suppressed: a
95-character answer reached the client as its first six, with no event and
`finish_reason: stop`.

The fix for that dropped the parser instead -- and dropping the parser also
drops everything else a parser does. A format whose framing wraps *every*
answer then leaks that framing: Kimi-K3's `Hello there.` arrived as
`<|open|>response<|sep|>Hello there.<|close|>response<|sep|><|end_of_msg|>`
the moment a request said `none`. The format still has to be read; what is
suppressed is dispatch. `ToolCallStreamParser(suppress_calls=True)` and
:func:`parse_tool_calls(..., suppress_calls=True)` read the region exactly as
a permitted one and drop only the calls, so the answer around a forbidden call
survives and the call's own markup does not. Releasing those bytes instead was
tried first and is what leaked the wire format: they are not prose, whatever
the request said about dispatch.
