"""SSE frame encoding and inspection for the streaming endpoints.

One frame is encoded per streamed chunk per request, so at high concurrency
this is one of the fixed per-token costs that caps the API server before the
GPU does. ``msgspec`` with a reusable encoder measures 5.8x faster than
``json.dumps`` on a chat delta (0.25 vs 1.47 us/chunk; see
``/app/logs_claude/bench_sse_encode.py``).

Encoding straight to ``bytes`` and letting the ASGI layer write them is another
10% on top, but the frame builders are shared with the atomesh service, which
assembles ``list[str]`` batches -- not worth splitting them for 1.6% of the
original cost.

Unlike ``json.dumps``, msgspec rejects NaN and Infinity rather than emitting
the non-standard literals. Any float that can reach a frame (logprobs, for
instance) has to be sanitised before it gets here.
