"""Chat-template dispatch for the OpenAI chat endpoint.

Some models (e.g. DeepSeek V4) ship a Python encoder under ``<model>/encoding/``
instead of a Jinja ``chat_template``. This module discovers such encoders at
server startup and provides :func:`apply_chat_template`, a single entry point
that the request handler calls — it transparently routes to the custom encoder
when one was found, or to ``tokenizer.apply_chat_template`` otherwise.
