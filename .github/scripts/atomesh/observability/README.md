# Agentic PD inference reports

Agentic PD benchmarks (`benchmark.kind: aiperf_agentic`) automatically collect
metrics and generate an offline HTML report for each concurrency setting. No
additional workflow input or long-running monitoring server is required.

GPU event timing is disabled by default in ATOM. Agentic CI sets
`ATOM_ENABLE_METRICS_DEVICE_TIMER=1` on the prefill and decode services so their
GPU panels have data. Set `env.common.ATOM_ENABLE_METRICS_DEVICE_TIMER: "0"` in the job
configuration to disable it; GPU panels then have no samples. Other metrics
remain available. Event polling stops at the first unfinished event and reuses
completed pairs, with at most 256 pending pairs per worker and no GPU synchronization.

Each matrix job uploads its own `atomesh-latency-<matrix-id>-<attempt>` artifact.
The job summary contains **Download HTML reports and data**. Download and extract
that artifact, then open a `report.html` file. GitHub Actions summaries cannot
execute the report's JavaScript; the report runs locally without a server.

The report defaults to an eight-panel Overview with Prefill/Decode TTFT, queue
time, total cache reuse, and GPU forward latency. Use Latency, Workload, Cache & KV, or
All metrics to inspect the full set. Desktop charts use two columns:

- Mesh overall TTFT: ingress to first generated streaming output.
- Decode ITL: output intervals normalized and weighted by new token count.
- Prefill local TTFT: request arrival to first internal token delivery.
- Decode local TTFT: request arrival to first generated streaming output.
- Prefill and Decode request queues: running, waiting, and external KV waits.
- Prefill and Decode queue time: engine receipt to first forward dispatch,
  including input queue residence, scheduling, and KV loading waits.
- Actual decode batch size: real decode request rows in each forward.
- PD KV transfer wait: Decode-side remote load wait until all workers finish.
- Prefill and Decode KV block utilization: used, evictable cached, and vacant.
- Prefill and Decode cache reuse: Total reuse, LMCache and GPU curves shown
  together, each divided by input tokens. The panel also shows estimated
  Reused / Input and LMCache / GPU tokens in the same window.
- Uncached prompt tokens per request and actual prefill tokens per forward.
- Prefill batch context tokens: sum of the prefill rows' logical context lengths
  through the current chunk, including cached and previously computed prefixes.
- Prefill request context length: full input token count, including cached
  prefixes, recorded once at first real local prefill dispatch. A 100K prompt
  split into 4K chunks produces one 100K value; later chunks and preemption do
  not add samples. The per-batch context above still measures each chunk end.
- Decode batch context tokens: sum of logical sequence lengths per real batch.
- Decode request context length: exact token count at the first real decode
  dispatch, once per request sequence.
- Prefill and Decode GPU forward: per-worker device-event duration, including
  stream communication/waits; PP samples cover each local stage, not the full pipeline.

Both request context metrics are collected through Prometheus `/metrics` as
Gauges with request ID and phase dispatch-time labels. Scatter plots show each
request; hover for identity or use Data table / CSV for all values. Repeated
scrapes do not create additional report rows. Samples persist until the service's
metrics directory is cleaned, so series count grows with requests. These CPU
scheduler metrics are available even when GPU event timing is disabled.

Mean, P50, P90, P95, and P99 can be toggled globally or per chart. The report also
supports hiding charts, time-range selection, a data table, and CSV export.
All / Prefill / Decode buttons filter both charts and metric selection buttons;
CSV exports follow that selection. In All view, shared metrics align Prefill on
the left and Decode on the right, followed by the remaining metrics. Individual
chart and series selections are retained when switching roles. Small screens
stack charts in the same order.
The global Statistics controls contain only Mean, P50, P90, P95, and P99.
Queue and KV state controls stay inside their own panels. Units are milliseconds,
requests, tokens, or percent as indicated on each chart and in the CSV.
The existing KV utilization panels also display summed Used / Total block
counts for the latest point in the selected range, or the hovered point.
Their data tables and CSV include the raw counts with unit `blocks`.

Independent Prefill/Decode instance selectors use host:port addresses, including
multiple services on one machine. The default pools all instances. Selecting an
instance updates charts, counts, tables and CSV (`instance` column); missing data
stays missing. Configured unavailable targets remain selectable. Mesh TTFT stays
global. Instance percentiles are computed from grouped histogram buckets; global
percentiles and ratios pool raw observations/counts rather than averaging
instance quantiles or percentages. Archived JSON without an instance breakdown
still renders its aggregate data.
Cache contributions share the full-input denominator and admission accounting.
The LMCache numerator is `atom:prefix_cache_offload_tokens_total`, which counts
supplemental admitted reuse beyond the GPU prefix, rather than physical transfer
volume or backend lookup success. Disabled LMCache reports zero contribution;
missing tier telemetry remains unknown, including incomplete instance coverage.
Pure PD consumers record their own pre-existing prefix once on first-decode
admission after successful KV receive. Received KV and the producer's inherited
API cache-hit value are excluded. Cache hits do not measure PD transfer savings:
the transfer backend may still require a full transfer for its topology/state.
Use each panel's legend to toggle the three curves independently. Tables and CSV
include the tier quantities and selected percentage curves.
See [metric definitions](../../../../docs/metrics_guide.md) for the full metric
reference and how to add a new metric.

## Collection lifecycle

The workflow explicitly enables `ATOMESH_BUILD_MESH=true` for agentic cells.
Before launching the rank-0 service container, `../setup_mesh.sh` runs a separate
build container using `../build_mesh.sh`. It builds the reviewed source with
`ATOMESH_MESH_BUILD_PROFILE=release` (or an explicitly selected `ci` profile).
A writable source copy supports read-only checkouts. The binary, build log,
resolved lockfile and `mesh-build.json` (commit, profile, Cargo version, source
dirty status and checksums) are retained under the job's `mesh-build/` directory.
Benchmark and eval phases reuse that artifact through `ATOMESH_MESH_BINARY`;
router startup only consumes the path. A supplied `ATOMESH_MESH_BINARY` skips
building. Direct server launches default to the image's release binary.

For each AIPerf invocation, `collect_metrics.py` starts its own Prometheus process
on a dynamically assigned loopback port, scraping all resolved Prefill/Decode
addresses and Mesh's configured metrics port. Addresses and ports come from the
same arrays used to launch the services, including multiple hosts and workers.
For multi-node DP, include every node's `--server-port` as a target (repeat
`--prefill` / `--decode`); native histogram storage is local to each node.
The coordinator's endpoint does not include remote histogram observations.

Prometheus 3.5.0 is downloaded and verified against its release checksums when
no executable is already available. `ATOMESH_PROMETHEUS_BIN` can point to an
installed executable. `ATOMESH_MESH_TARGET_DIR` selects the host's persistent
Cargo build cache (default: `/tmp/atomesh-mesh-cache-<uid>`), mounted into the
setup container. If the image's Rust installation is inaccessible to the CI
user, setup installs Rust 1.94.0 into that cache; `ATOMESH_MESH_RUST_TOOLCHAIN`
can select another fallback version. These settings pass through the existing
CI environment handling and are independent of metrics collection.

The TSDB uses temporary node-local storage. Scraping and engine/API snapshots
default to every second (subject to engine progress). Set
`ATOM_METRICS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S` before starting all service processes to change
the shared internal update interval; invalid values log a warning and fall back
to 1 second. Valid values must be finite and positive. Configure
the collector separately with `--scrape-interval-seconds`, placed before the
`--` introducing the benchmark command. It accepts seconds at millisecond
precision, with a minimum of `0.001`; for example, `0.5` produces `500ms` scrapes.
The scrape timeout is the smaller of the interval and one second. Startup,
baseline and final-scrape waits grow as needed for longer intervals.

Histogram observations accumulate at each event, including events between
scrapes. Plots use five-second steps; histogram points summarize the preceding
`max(60, 4 × scrape interval)` seconds, while queues and KV panels show sampled
state. Brief queue peaks between snapshots may be missed. These settings do not
add a periodic text cache to `/metrics`; responses are still rendered on demand.
Each invocation uses a
fresh TSDB and counter baselines, so previous benchmark traffic is excluded.
Collection covers the complete AIPerf invocation, including its warmup and drain.
API TTFT exposes zero-valued `streaming=true` and `streaming=false` series at
startup, so the collector can scrape a baseline before the first request.
Percentiles are histogram estimates; Prefill and Decode percentiles cannot be
added to obtain Mesh percentiles.

The Latency view also includes **Prefill request GPU forward**. Each worker sums
the batch forward durations in which a request participates across its initial
local prefill chunks, then records one sample after all those timings complete.
Three chunks taking 10, 12 and 8 ms yield one 30 ms request sample. Shared or
mixed batches contribute their full duration to each participating prefill
request; this is not exclusive per-request compute time. Inter-chunk queue/KV
waits are excluded. Missing chunk timings invalidate the entire request sample.
PP samples cover each local stage, and worker distributions are pooled rather
than summing rank times. The rolling window selects completed timing samples,
which may include chunks executed before the window. Instance filters, the five
statistics, tables and CSV work as for the existing per-forward panel.

After the command finishes, the wrapper waits for a successful scrape from each
target with a scrape timestamp after the benchmark end, then waits until the
next five-second query step includes those scrapes. This wait is bounded to 30
seconds and stops early on interruption; failures are reported while retaining
available data. `status.json` keeps `end` and `benchmark_end` as the command's end
and records the export cutoff separately as `collection_end`. Report metadata
also includes `benchmark_end` and `collection_end`; its `end` covers the export
range. Report notes identify the extra collection interval, which is excluded
from the benchmark duration and may include other traffic during that interval.

The wrapper then collects report data, terminates Prometheus, finalizes
diagnostics, and renders HTML once. Benchmark failures
retain the original exit code and any available metrics. Publication failures
are recorded separately in `status.json` under `publication_errors`, and do not
replace the benchmark exit code. If the status file itself cannot be written,
the error is printed in the job log. Collection failures produce an explicitly
incomplete report and a warning in Actions instead of fabricated data.
Hard termination before export can leave only status and logs.
A panel is marked missing only when all its statistics lack valid samples.
Failed statistic queries still mark the report partial when other data is
available; a missing quantile alone does not make the report unavailable.

Reports live under
`slurm_job-<job-id>/benchmark_results/aiperf-<model>-<topology>-c<concurrency>/metrics/`.
Artifact staging selects only the current matrix ID and recorded Slurm job ID.
It never searches previous runs for a report when the current job has no report.

## Reusing the report interface

Export from a running Prometheus instance:

```bash
python .github/scripts/atomesh/observability/export_report.py \
  --prometheus-url http://127.0.0.1:9090 \
  --start 2026-09-08T10:46:23Z --end 2026-09-08T10:56:26Z \
  --deployment pd --model 'GLM-5.2 · CPP4 + DCP4' \
  --output report.html --save-data report-data.json
```

Rebuild HTML from archived data:

```bash
python .github/scripts/atomesh/observability/export_report.py \
  --input-json report-data.json --output report.html
```

Python callers can use `collect_report(...)` to fetch data without writing files,
`write_report(data, output)` to render data, or `generate_report(...)` as a
convenience API that does both. The JSON interface uses
Unix timestamps in seconds, values in the panel's `unit` (default `ms` for older
reports), and `null` for missing points. Gauge panels set `kind` to `queues` or
`blocks` and use state names as series keys. See `report-data.example.json` for
a small synthetic latency example.
KV panels additionally carry `block_counts.used` and `block_counts.total`
time series; older JSON without these fields displays unavailable counts as a dash.
Cache panels use `kind: "cache"`, `cache_breakdown: true`, percentage series
`reuse/gpu/lmcache`, and `cache_counts.reused/prompt/gpu/lmcache` (rolling
`increase()` estimates, in tokens). Archived cache panels without the breakdown
flag retain their original GPU-only `hit` and `cache_counts.cached/prompt` meaning.
Each panel can also supply `instances: {"host:port": {"series": ..., ...}}` with
the same series/count fields. `meta.instances` lists configured role/instance
pairs, including unavailable services. Optional `category` and `overview` fields
control the focus filters.
