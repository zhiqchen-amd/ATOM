"""CPU unit tests for `make_compress_plans` write/compress slice capacities.

Covers the three slicing modes (eager / decode-CUDAGraph / extend-shaped verify)
and the CUDAGraph invariance that lets the decode write grid shrink to
`running_bs * min(qlen, K_pool)` while keeping `[bs, running_bs)` padding rows
sentinel-filled. No GPU required — a fake CpuGpuBuffer backs the plan tensors.
