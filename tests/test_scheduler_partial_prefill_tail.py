"""Regression test for the MTP spec-decode IndexError caused by re-queuing a
skipped partial prefill at the head of ``running``.

When the cross-DP ``PrefillDelayer`` vetoes prefill for a tick, a partial
(chunked, prompt-not-done) prefill can be popped by the decode loop and skipped.
The scheduler used to re-insert such seqs at the HEAD of ``running``
(``extendleft``), pinning the partial at ``running[0]``. Once it finishes
prefill it becomes the batch's position-0 *deferred* seq, shifting the fresh
decode seqs to positions 1..N; ``TokenIDProcessor.prepare_input_ids`` then takes
the ``[deferred | new]`` path and indexes the compacted
``scheduled_spec_decode_tokens`` array by those shifted positions, running off
the end:

    IndexError: index N is out of bounds for axis 0 with size N

The original fix re-queued skipped partial prefills at the TAIL (``extend``),
so they never occupy position 0 and the new decode seqs stay contiguous from 0
(safe ``[new | deferred]`` slice path). That kept the compacted array
accidentally aligned rather than making it aligned; any other way of putting a
draft-less sequence ahead of a drafted one brings the same IndexError back — or,
short of the end of the array, silently feeds one sequence another's drafts.

``ScheduledBatch`` now builds the array with one row per sequence in batch
order, zero-filled where a sequence has no drafts, so alignment no longer
depends on queue position. Both properties are tested here: the tail placement
(still the intended scheduling behaviour) and the alignment itself.
