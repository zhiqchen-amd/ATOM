"""Regression test for the MTP spec-decode IndexError caused by re-queuing a
skipped partial prefill at the head of ``running``.

When the cross-DP ``PrefillDelayer`` vetoes prefill for a tick, a partial
(chunked, prompt-not-done) prefill can be popped by the decode loop and skipped.
The scheduler used to re-insert such seqs at the HEAD of ``running``
(``extendleft``), pinning the partial at ``running[0]``. Once it finishes
prefill it becomes the batch's position-0 *deferred* seq, shifting the fresh
decode seqs to positions 1..N; ``TokenIDProcessor.prepare_input_ids`` then takes
the ``[deferred | new]`` path and indexes the compacted
``scheduled_spec_decode_tokens`` array by those shifted positions, running off
the end:

    IndexError: index N is out of bounds for axis 0 with size N

The fix re-queues skipped partial prefills at the TAIL (``extend``), so they
never occupy position 0 and the new decode seqs stay contiguous from 0 (safe
``[new | deferred]`` slice path). This test drives the real
``Scheduler.schedule()`` and asserts the skipped partial lands at the tail.
