"""Properties the streaming text pipeline must hold for every format it knows.

Not a list of cases. The corpus is *generated* from the two production
registries -- ``reasoning_dialects.DIALECTS`` and the tool-parser
``registry.PARSERS_BY_NAME`` -- crossed with a handful of text shapes built
out of each entry's own declared markers. The parser registry and not
``_DETECT_ORDER``: the detect order omits the terminal fallback, so reading
it here meant this file's own axis was a union assembled by hand.
Registering a new model family or a new tool-call format therefore adds
coverage by itself, and
``test_every_registered_parser_declares_its_markers`` is what stops a new
entry from joining the registry without the declaration the generation needs.

Two properties, and they are not nested:

`chunk-invariance` -- the same text split differently must produce the same
    reasoning, the same content, the same tool events and the same finish
    reason. Catches markers split across boundaries, buffers carried between
    states, and a sniffer latching onto whatever it happened to see first.

`bounded withhold` -- text must not be held back longer than a marker could
    justify. Judged against the same text with its trigger characters
    neutralised, because an absolute budget cannot tell a stall from the
    reasoning channel legitimately withholding until its end marker arrives.

The stall is *chunk-invariant* -- everything comes out at flush no matter how
the input was split -- so the first property cannot see it and the second is
not redundant. Both are needed.

The pipeline modelled is `serving_chat.py:280-333`: reasoning filter first,
its content segments into the tool parser, both flushed on the last chunk.

    be preferred. So which of the two fires is a function of where the

    Harmless while both halves agree about handing the stream over, and today
    every pair does: K3's three are all channel framing that opens no region,
    so either way the marker is dropped and the remainder is caught as its own
    marker. Measured -- a K3 answer comes out identical at seven chunk sizes.

    before their arguments: "does not name prose" is a different claim from
    "names a real call early", and only the second is format-specific. Gating
    both on the same table skipped ten cases that pass.

    A name cannot be retracted. If the peek names a region and the parse then
    reads that same region as prose, the client has been told about a call
    that does not exist -- on `/v1/chat/completions` as a `tool_calls` delta
    whose `arguments` is `""`, which every agent loop feeds to `json.loads`,
    and on `/v1/messages` as a syntactically complete `tool_use` block with
    `input: {}` that a client cannot tell from a real zero-argument call.

    Four of the five formats that announce had the two disagree, because each
    wrote the rule twice: a follower set in a peek regex, a truncation test in
    `parse`. Qwen's peek accepted `</tool_call>` -- which closes the *outer*
    wrapper and leaves the `<function=` block unterminated, so `parse` read it
    as prose. Each format now answers the question once, from one constant,
    and both callers ask it.

    Which is also this property's limit, and worth being plain about: with one
    constant per format the two *cannot* disagree, so no mutation of that
    constant will fail this. What it guards is the next format, or the next
    rewrite, that goes back to writing the rule twice --
    `test_a_looser_peek_is_caught` is what shows it still can.

    accepted call begins. Kimi pulled it back to the first thing its entry

    had already rejected -- and deleted the sentence in between as markup.

    Five formats kept it and one did not, which is what made the answer a
    fact to look up rather than a decision to make.

    The quotation has to be one the format's own pattern *matches* and its
    gate then rejects -- `quoting_a_call_it_will_not_make`, not
    `quoting_the_opener`. Built from the latter this class passed on HEAD, on
    every format: Kimi's entry pattern needs `functions.NAME:INDEX`, an
    opener alone does not match it, and with no rejected match there is no
