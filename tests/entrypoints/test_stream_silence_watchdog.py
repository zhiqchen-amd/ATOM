"""A stalled response has to be visible while it is stalled.

The symptom this whole line of work started from was ten minutes of silence on
a streaming request with every metric looking healthy. The cause is fixed, and
the next one will be different — so the observation is worth having on its own.

Measured around the *yield to the client*, not around the collector's await.
The collector is the one place a stream waits for the engine, but two stages
sit between it and the socket — the reasoning channel's read-ahead and the
tool-call format's — and while either withholds, the collector keeps returning
on schedule. Watching there reported zero for exactly the stall it was built
to catch; `TestWithholdingIsSilenceToo` is that case.

Deliberately not `asyncio.wait_for`. This runs once per frame per stream;
arming a timer measured 1.38 us against 0.07 us for a timestamp and a dict
entry, and a timestamp needs no background task to own.
