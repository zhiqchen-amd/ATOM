"""Each decode request must receive ITS OWN anchor and drafts.

The predecessor of `fill_deferred_decode_ids` placed the carried-over requests
and the newly admitted ones as two contiguous BLOCKS, which is only right when
the scheduler happens to order the batch that way. It does not — the two kinds
interleave — so every request could be fed a neighbour's token. End to end that
read as "chunked prefill loses accuracy", because a chunked prefill is what
lands a forward between two decode steps and makes the batch stop matching the
previous one (GSM8K 0.9098 -> 0.9484 on the fix).

The property tests below run against the pure-torch reference, on CPU, so CI
executes them. `test_kernel_matches_reference` needs a GPU and is skipped
without one.

Deliberately NOT written as kernel-vs-reference alone: both would express the
same addressing, so a wrong contract moves them together and they still agree.
The tests that matter here state what the caller is owed — whose token lands
where — and are checked against the reference directly.
