"""Compressing a prompt in two chunks must equal compressing it in one.

A chunked prefill runs the compressor once per chunk, carrying `kv_state` /
`score_state` across, so a prompt cut at a rung takes a different path through
the compressor than the same prompt fed whole. Everything downstream reads the
compressed rows for the rest of the request's life -- unlike the sliding
window, they are never rebuilt by decode -- so any inequality here is a
permanent divergence, not a transient one.

Written while chunked prefill was suspected of costing accuracy. It does not
-- that turned out to be a drafter bug, and the compressor is bit-exact here
-- so this pins the boundary rather than reproducing a known failure.

The cut is placed on a multiple of `ratio` so the compression groups
themselves are identical between the two arms; what is under test is purely
whether the state handed across the boundary reproduces what the one-shot run
had in flight at that point.
