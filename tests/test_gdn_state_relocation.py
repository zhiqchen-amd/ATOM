# Tests for relocating a GDN state slot's bytes.
#
# GDN checkpoints by forking, so this path is not about checkpoints: moving the
# state pool's boundary has to be able to shift a slot out of the way, and that
# is a byte move whatever mechanism the class uses to checkpoint.
#
# The unit that moves is one slot -- one complete recurrent state, across every
# layer. A request under speculative decoding holds `1 + num_spec` of them, but
# they are allocated one at a time and need not be adjacent, so relocating such
# a request is several pairs rather than one wider pair. That is the whole point
# of the per-slot allocation: a checkpoint holds a committed state and has no
# speculation to roll back, so it costs one slot rather than a full group.
