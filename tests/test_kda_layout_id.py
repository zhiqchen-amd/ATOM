"""What a K3 state-checkpoint layout id has to encode, and what must move it.

A PAGE image is raw bytes. The scheduler reserves units against one geometry
and a worker reassembles them against its own, so the only thing standing
between a mismatched pair and silently misplaced state is this string. Every
property that changes where a byte lands has to change the id.

The id is asked of `state_transfer()` rather than re-derived beside the test:
re-deriving it would assert that two copies of the same expression agree, which
is what the production one already does with itself.
