# Watch an in-flight ATOM inference workload (server OR offline simple_inference).
# Exit 0 when the workload drains cleanly, exit 1 on hang, exit 2 on GPU fault.
#
# Workload modes (auto-detected by process pattern):
#   - Server mode  (atom.entrypoints): drains when eval client (lm_eval / curl
#                  / benchmark) is gone and a single poll shows no new output.
#                  Hang = STUCK_POLLS consecutive polls with no new "Engine
#                  Core: output send" while a client is still hammering.
#   - Offline mode (atom.examples.simple_inference / atom.examples.benchmark):
#                  drains when the inference process exits naturally (no fault
#                  in log). Hang detection is N/A (no client concept; no
#                  Engine Core ZMQ progress).
#
# Server log auto-discovery: the canonical signal for "engine made progress"
# is `Engine Core: output send` in the server's stdout. Rather than asking
# the caller to know where the server log lives, the script `readlink`s
# `/proc/<pid>/fd/1` of the atom.entrypoints process and uses THAT as the
# authoritative server log — path-independent across repo layouts. Falls
# back to the caller-supplied LOG_FILE only if /proc lookup fails.
#
# The caller-supplied LOG_FILE is still useful as a SECONDARY signal:
#   - Fault grep runs on BOTH server log AND caller LOG_FILE (max coverage)
#   - File-mtime growth on caller LOG_FILE counts as progress when the
#     engine marker is absent (e.g. simple_inference offline, benchmark tqdm)
#
# Use this script for ANY blocking wait on an ATOM workload — don't fall back
# to `sleep + tail`. Offline path is supported in-script so you can wrap
# simple_inference the same way as server runs.
#
# Liveness: pgrep `$SERVER_PATTERN` (NOT curl /v1/models — under heavy load
# the HTTP endpoint can fail to respond within reasonable timeout even when
# the server is alive, producing false-positive "dead" reports).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/wait_infer_drain.sh [PORT] [MAX_MIN] [POLL_SEC] [LOG_FILE] [STUCK_POLLS] [STARTUP_MAX_MIN]
#   PORT             default 8000  (kept for API symmetry with wait_server_ready.sh; unused in offline mode)
#   MAX_MIN          default 30    (full GSM8K 1319 typically 5-15 min on V4-Pro)
#   POLL_SEC         default 10    (fast poll for quick hang detection)
#   LOG_FILE         default empty (server log auto-discovered via /proc). Pass a
#                    client/workload log (e.g. benchmark.log, simple_inference.log)
#                    to add it as a secondary signal source for fault grep and
#                    mtime-based progress detection.
#   STUCK_POLLS      default 6     (6 × 10s = 1 min of no progress → declare hang)
#   STARTUP_MAX_MIN  default 15    (how long to wait for the workload python
#                                   process to first appear before giving up;
#                                   V4-Pro launchers spend minutes in GPU
#                                   cleanup + cache prep + model load before
#                                   exec'ing python. During this window the
#                                   pgrep miss must NOT be interpreted as a
#                                   clean exit.)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — workload drained cleanly (server: client gone + no pending output;
#                                 offline: process exited without fault)
#   1 — hang detected (server only: no progress while client running)
#   2 — fault detected (MEMORY_VIOLATION / ASSERT_TRAP / Memory access fault / proc died)
#   4 — max wait elapsed without resolution
